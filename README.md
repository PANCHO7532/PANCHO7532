### Welcome to my profile xD
I'm PANCHO7532, the most normal of the guys that you'll find around there

### What you will find here
This GitHub profile is probably my entire portfolio containing every "serious" project that i programmed in my life

You can also check my GitLab profile [here](https://gitlab.com/PANCHO7532), it serves as a backup just in case my profile gets mysteriously nuked to the stratosphere

I'm still learning stuff, so, sorry for possible spaghetti around there

### Most used programming languages
![xd](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=PANCHO7532&layout=compact)

I'm more of a javascript guy, but i'm always open to learn new stuff about any programming language (except Python)

### Welcome to my profile xD
I'm PANCHO7532, the most normal of the guys that you'll find around there

### What you will find here
This GitHub profile is probably my entire portfolio containing every "serious" project that i programmed in my life

You can also check my GitLab profile [here](https://gitlab.com/PANCHO7532), it serves as a backup just in case my profile gets mysteriously nuked to the stratosphere

I'm still learning stuff, so, sorry for possible spaghetti around there

### Most used programming languages

- JavaScript
- C++
- Java
- PHP

I'm more of a javascript guy, but i'm always open to learn new stuff about any programming language

- How to reach me: [Telegram](https://t.me/PANCHO7532)
- Pronouns: he/him
- Slightly fun facts about me:
  1) I haven't used an emoji since 11 years probably, i kinda hate them.
  2) I unironically used a Windows XP machine for 5 months as my daily driver (you guys lied to me it wasn't a health hazard as you make it seem)
  3) ?
